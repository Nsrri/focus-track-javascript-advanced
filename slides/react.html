            ## Quiz part 1

            ---

            What is a component?

            ---

            ### Component
            A piece of the UI that we can reuse.

            ---

            What are props?

            ---

            ### props

            Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

            ---

            What is useState?

            ---

            ### useState

            As react rerenders (executes) a component many times, state can not be stored in "normal" variables. `useState` helps to keep state even when the component rerenders.

            ---

            ### useState

            Additionally, it triggers a rerender.
            ```
            useState(0) -> 0 is displayed on the screen
            click updates state to 1 -> rerender
            1 is displayed on the screen
            ```

            What is useEffect?

            ---

            ### useEffect

            The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects. <small>https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html</small>

            A side effect is code which affects something outside of your component.
            * network requests
            * manipulate the DOM directly
            * setTimeout (uses a browser API)
